WPDeworm
========

Clean wormed (cracked/hacked) WordPress installation

Requirments
-----------

* PHP 5 >= 5.2.0
* cURL PHP extension

Notes
-----

For now able to find the plugins of WP in all subdirectories, download the original zip packages from wordpress.org, store them in a separate directory while maintaining the structure.

Then extract this zip file, if it is posible and delete this zip.

It saves a lot of time. Of course, there are also plugins for WP that allow the forced update, but when WP is full of bugs, it is very much struggling :-) 

I plan to add these posibilities
--------------------------------

* delete all files from installed plugins and replacing them with unpacked packages
* clean DB of wormed WordPress installation
