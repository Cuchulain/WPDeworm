Clean wormed (cracked/hacked) WordPress installation

Notes
-----

For now able to find the plugins of WP in all subdirectories, download the original zip packages from wordpress.org and store them in a separate directory while maintaining the structure. 
It saves a lot of time. Of course, there are also plugins for WP that allow the forced update, but when WP is full of bugs, it is very much struggling :-) 

I plan to add these posibilities:
* delete all files from installed plugins and replacing them with unpacked packages
* clean DB of wormed WordPress installation
